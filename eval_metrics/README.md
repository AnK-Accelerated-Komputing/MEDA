We use [modified_original.py](modified_original.py) to evaluate the stl files generated by MEDA. The code is refactored from the [icp_original.py](icp_original.py) provided by the authors of CADCodeVerify. The [eval_metrics_gicp.py](eval_metrics_gicp.py) uses global registration method to align the model before evaluation but has not been used for evaluation to be consistent in evaluation with CADCodeVerify.
